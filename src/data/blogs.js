      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Buying property in Kenya can be an exciting journey, but it's also fraught with potential pitfalls that can cost you dearly. Whether you're a first-time buyer or seasoned investor, avoiding these common mistakes will save you time, money, and stress.</p>
      
      <h2>1. Skipping Due Diligence on Property Documents</h2>
      <p>One of the most critical mistakes buyers make is not thoroughly verifying property documents. Always ensure:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The title deed is genuine and registered</li>
        <li>There are no pending legal disputes</li>
        <li>All taxes and rates are up to date</li>
        <li>The seller is the legitimate owner</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>2. Ignoring Location and Future Development Plans</h2>
      <p>Location remains the golden rule in real estate. Research the area's:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Infrastructure development plans</li>
        <li>Security situation and crime rates</li>
        <li>Proximity to amenities like schools, hospitals, and shopping centers</li>
        <li>Future government projects that might affect property values</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>3. Not Getting a Professional Property Valuation</h2>
      <p>Many buyers rely on the seller's asking price without getting an independent valuation. A professional valuer will help you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand the true market value</li>
        <li>Negotiate from an informed position</li>
        <li>Avoid overpaying for the property</li>
        <li>Identify any structural issues that might affect value</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>4. Underestimating Additional Costs</h2>
      <p>The purchase price is just one part of the total cost. Budget for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Legal fees (typically 1-2% of property value)</li>
        <li>Stamp duty (4% of property value)</li>
        <li>Land transfer fees</li>
        <li>Survey and valuation costs</li>
        <li>Registration fees</li>
        <li>Moving and immediate repair costs</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>5. Rushing the Purchase Decision</h2>
      <p>Property is a long-term investment. Take time to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visit the property multiple times at different hours</li>
        <li>Talk to neighbors about the area</li>
        <li>Research recent sales in the neighborhood</li>
        <li>Consider your long-term needs and plans</li>
        <li>Get multiple opinions from trusted advisors</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Avoiding these common mistakes will significantly increase your chances of making a successful property purchase. Remember, taking time for proper due diligence is an investment in your peace of mind and financial security.</p>

      <h2>The Eternal Question: Rent or Buy?</h2>
      <p>In Kenya's dynamic property market, deciding whether to rent or buy depends on various personal and economic factors. Let's analyze the current market conditions and help you make an informed decision.</p>

        <li>Could you invest the down payment elsewhere for better returns?</li>
